requested}
\usage{
pkg_attach(
  ...,
  install = FALSE,
  message = getOption("xfun.pkg_attach.message", TRUE)
)

pkg_load(..., error = TRUE, install = FALSE)

loadable(pkg, strict = TRUE, new_session = FALSE)

}
\arguments{
\item{...}{Package names (character vectors, and must always be quoted).}

\item{install}{Whether to automatically install packages that are not
available using \code{\link[=install.packages]{install.packages()}}. Besides \code{TRUE} and
\code{FALSE}, the value of this argument can also be a function to install
packages (\code{install = TRUE} is equivalent to \code{install = install.packages}), or a character string \code{"pak"} (equivalent to
\code{install = pak::pkg_install}, which requires the \pkg{pak} package).
You are recommended to set a CRAN mirror in the global option \code{repos}
via \code{\link[=options]{options()}} if you want to automatically install packages.}

\item{message}{Whether to show the package startup messages (if any startup
messages are provided in a package).}

\item{error}{Whether to signal an error when certain packages cannot be loaded.}

\item{pkg}{A single package name.}

\item{strict}{If \code{TRUE}, use \code{\link[=requireNamespace]{requireNamespace()}} to test if
a package is loadable; otherwise only check if the package is in
\code{\link{.packages}}\code{(TRUE)} (this does not really load the package, so it
is less rigorous but on the other hand, it can keep the current R session
clean).}

\item{new_session}{Whether to test if a package is loadable in a new R
session. Note that \code{new_session = TRUE} implies \code{strict = TRUE}.}

\item{version}{A minimal version number. If \code{NULL}, only test if a
package is available and do not check its version.}
}
\value{
\code{pkg_attach()} returns \code{NULL} invisibly. \code{pkg_load()}
returns a logical vector, indicating whether the packages can be loaded.
}
\description{
\code{pkg_attach()} is a vectorized version of \code{\link[=library]{library()}} over
the \code{package} argument to attach multiple packages in a single function
call. \code{pkg_load()} is a vectorized version of
\code{\link[=requireNamespace]{requireNamespace()}} to load packages (without attaching them).
The functions \code{pkg_attach2()} and \code{pkg_load2()} are wrappers of
\code{pkg_attach(install = TRUE)} and \code{pkg_load(install = TRUE)},
respectively. \code{loadable()} is an abbreviation of
\code{requireNamespace(quietly = TRUE)}. \code{pkg_available()} tests if a
package with a minimal version is available.
}
\details{
These are convenience functions that aim to solve these common problems: (1)
We often need to attach or load multiple packages, and it is tedious to type
several \code{library()} calls; (2) We are likely to want to install the
packages when attaching/loading them but they have not been installed.
}
\examples{
library(xfun)
pkg_attach("stats", "graphics")
# pkg_attach2('servr') # automatically install servr if it is not installed

(pkg_load("stats", "graphics"))
}
\seealso{
\code{pkg_attach2()} is similar to \code{pacman::p_load()}, but does
not allow non-standard evaluation (NSE) of the \code{...} argument, i.e.,
you must pass a real character vector of package names to it, and all names
must be quoted. Allowing NSE adds too much complexity with too little gain
(the only gain is that it saves your effort in typing two quotes).
