\title{Submit check jobs to crandalf}
\usage{
crandalf_check(pkg, size = 400, jobs = Inf, which = "all")

crandalf_results(pkg, repo = NA, limit = 200, wait = 5 * 60)
}
\arguments{
\item{pkg}{The package name of which the reverse dependencies are to be
checked.}

\item{size}{The number of reverse dependencies to be checked in each job.}

\item{jobs}{The number of jobs to run in Github Actions (by default, all jobs
are submitted, but you can choose to submit the first few jobs).}

\item{which}{The type of dependencies (see \code{\link[=rev_check]{rev_check()}}).}

\item{repo}{The crandalf repo on Github (of the form \code{user/repo} such as
\code{"yihui/crandalf"}). Usually you do not need to specify it, unless you
are not calling this function inside the crandalf project, because
\command{gh} should be able to figure out the repo automatically.}

\item{limit}{The maximum of records for \command{gh run list} to retrieve.
You only need a larger number if the check results are very early in the
Github Action history.}

\item{wait}{Number of seconds to wait if not all jobs have been completed on
Github. By default, this function checks the status every 5 minutes until
all jobs are completed. Set \code{wait} to 0 to disable waiting (and throw
an error immediately when any jobs are not completed).}
}
\description{
Check the reverse dependencies of a package using the crandalf service:
\url{https://github.com/yihui/crandalf}. If the number of reverse
dependencies is large, they will be split into batches and pushed to crandalf
one by one.
}
\details{
Due to the time limit of a single job on Github Actions (6 hours), you will
have to split the large number of reverse dependencies into batches and check
them sequentially on Github (at most 5 jobs in parallel). The function
\code{crandalf_check()} does this automatically when necessary. It requires
the \command{git} command to be available.

The function \code{crandalf_results()} fetches check results from Github
after all checks are completed, merge the results, and show a full summary of
check results. It requires \code{gh} (Github CLI:
\url{https://cli.github.com/manual/}) to be installed and you also need to
authenticate with your Github account beforehand.
