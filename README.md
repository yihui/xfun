This package contains several utility functions that I frequently use in other packages, and also miscellaneous functions that I use by myself from time to time. For more information, see https://yihui.org/xfun/.

To install the package from CRAN, use `install.packages('xfun')`. To install the development version here, you may set the `repos` option to <https://yihui.r-universe.dev>:

```r
install.packages('xfun', repos = 'https://yihui.r-universe.dev')
```
